I am a graduate student in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working in the <a href="https://currielab.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Currie lab</a> and <a href="https://pringlelab.botany.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Pringle lab</a>, where I study the fungal symbionts of the fungus-growing ant system. I am broadly interested in fungal evolution, symbioses, and the evolution of sexual reproduction.
