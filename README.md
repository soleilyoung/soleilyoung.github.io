 am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://hulllab.bmolchem.wisc.edu/">Hull lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I study nuclear behavior in the fungus <i>Cryptococcus deneoformans</i>. I recieved my Ph.D. in Microbiology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was co-advised by in the <a href="https://pringlelab.github.io/index.html/">Prof. Anne Pringle</a> and the <a href="https://currielab.wisc.edu/">Prof. Cameron Currie</a>. I am interested in the evolution of mutualisms, the evolution of sex, and how both of these affect genetic variation, particulary in fungi. I love thinking broadly and critically about the terminology used to discuss sexual reproduction, and how that in turn affects the questions we (as scientists) ask about sex.
